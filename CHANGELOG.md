# Changelog

All notable changes to Vulture will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned

- Mode-B (centralized server) hardening pass — see
  [docs/features/0036_public_release_hardening](docs/features/0036_public_release_hardening/)
  Phase 3 (or follow-up feature 0037).
- Frontend agent auto-discovery: replace hardcoded UI lists in
  `frontend/src/components/results/FindingsTable.tsx` with config
  derived from `GET /api/agents`.
- Continuous-integration gates: `actionlint`, `govulncheck`,
  `pip-audit`, `npm audit`.
- SBOM publication as a GitHub release artifact.

## [0.1.0] - YYYY-MM-DD

> Date and tag pinned at release time. See feature 0036 Phase 4.

### Added

- Initial public release.
- Go backend (orchestrator, JWT/API-key auth, PostgreSQL/SQLite
  persistence, Server-Sent Events streaming).
- Ten Python audit agents:
  - `chaos_engineering` — retry, circuit-breaker, timeout, fallback,
    blast-radius patterns.
  - `owasp` — OWASP Top 10 (injection, auth, crypto, misconfig,
    access control, etc.).
  - `soc2` — SOC 2 CC6/CC7/CC8 clauses, configurable per-clause.
  - `cwe` — full CWE 4.19.1 catalog (1,400+ weakness types) with
    taxonomic rollup and `path_equivalence` skill.
  - `prove` — formal provenance/finding verification.
  - `xss` — cross-site scripting scanner.
  - `ssdf` — NIST SP 800-218 SSDF v1.1 practice groups.
  - `discover` — endpoint discovery and attack-surface mapping.
  - `do178c` — DO-178C avionics safety checks.
  - `asvs` — OWASP ASVS v5.0.0 (345 requirements across 17 chapters
    and 3 verification levels).
- React SPA frontend (Vite + Tailwind v4) with native EventSource
  SSE streaming and i18n support for `en`, `es`, `de`, `fr`, `ja`,
  `pt`.
- CLI binary (`vulture scan / login / list / watch`) for headless
  audit execution.
- Memory system with cross-audit intelligence via pgvector
  embeddings (OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` or Ollama
  `nomic-embed-text`).
- Four documented deployment modes:
  - Mode A — developer laptop (`make docker-up`).
  - Mode B — centralized server.
  - Mode C — read-only viewer.
  - Mode D — CI client.
- Two-phase audit pipeline: deterministic skill-based pattern
  matching across the entire codebase, followed by optional
  LLM-driven deep analysis with automatic deduplication against
  prior findings.
- Configurable LLM provider via LiteLLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini,
  local models via Ollama / LM Studio / vLLM).

### Documented

- Apache-2.0 license throughout (repository, all 10 agent
  pyproject.toml manifests, frontend package.json).
- `NOTICE`, `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`, and per-data-directory
  `LICENSE.md` files for redistributed third-party content
  (MITRE CWE, OWASP ASVS, NIST SSDF).
- `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, PR
  template, bug-report and feature-request issue templates,
  security-advisory contact link.
